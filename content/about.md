## A long, long time ago... 

In a <strike>galaxy</strike> city near the East coast,

Computers, the internet, web design calls my name.
Self-taught, it just clicks. Met a girl--go to school, play the game.

Dive right into e-commerce/ZAP!
ArcaMax discovered, put on your professional cap.

But, desire for experience seeks networking that guy...
Decipher(ing) pixel perfect designs, Apples, Mac, Linux - oh my!

Now go be a Web Tek, programming full-stack.
Like a senior we begin rolling code back-to-back.

The past beckons, we are back with fresh knowledge and spice.
We build, explore, grow our skills with might.

Hey, it's a girl! you're a dad, whoa out of mind.
Learn the hard stuff, keep truckin, theres mountains to climb.

New faces, same places, another child, it's a boy!
With one of each, our life is filled with joy.

Change is on the horizon, we accept our destined fate.
Meet new teams + learn more things, the journey continues... wait?

The future is here, in this point in time.
The dream is still alive, dude... it's 2025?!

So here's to the journey, we've sure come along way.
I've enjoyed every moment, now that's all I have to say.
