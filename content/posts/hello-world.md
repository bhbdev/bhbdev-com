ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my humble place on the web.

The idea here is to showcase my skills, self-interests, and detail some projects that I have either started--or--contributed to over my career as a developer.

Speaking of titles, I'm really always stumped when people ask me what I do ðŸ¤”. With that said, 
I have held many different positions over my 20+ years of experience. Be sure to check out my 
[resume](../resume/) and some [projects](../projects/) that I've worked on.
